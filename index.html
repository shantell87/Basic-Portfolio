            <p>Hi! My name is Shantell.</p>

            <p>I’m passionate about providing quality Front End Web Development service in the Bay Area.
                I have experience with web development tech like JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Node.js.
                I’ve been doing Front End Web Development work for a short while, and I love it because it gives me the
                chance to explore my creative skills in the technical field I love so much. I always go above and beyond
                to ensure I am owning the skills I know and continuously learning new skills.
            </p>

            <p>My experience in Project Management has given me a strong commitment to data-driven decision making,
                including impacts on stakeholders. I hold communication in high regard; work well when collaborating
                with others or independently.</p>

            <p>I look forward to working with you to help meet all your Front End Web Development needs and
                collaborating with others to create meaningful web applications.</p>
